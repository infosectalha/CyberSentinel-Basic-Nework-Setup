# CyberSentinel-Basic-Nework-Setup
# 🧠 Basic Cisco Packet Tracer Network – 2 LANs via Router

This repository contains my first hands-on networking lab built using *Cisco Packet Tracer* as part of my learning with *Tech Hierarchy*.

## 🔧 Network Topology Overview

- 🖥 4 PCs (2 on each switch)
- 🔀 2 Switches
- 🌐 1 Router
- 🧵 Copper straight-through cables for all connections
- 🧠 Static IP addressing for all devices
- 📩 Communication successfully tested using *Simulation Mode (Mail Icon)*

## 📈 What I Learned

- Assigning IP addresses to devices manually
- Connecting devices with proper cables
- The roles of *switches* and *routers* in local and inter-network communication
- How to test device connectivity using *Cisco Packet Tracer simulation tools*

## 🚀 Next Steps

This was my first successful project using Cisco Packet Tracer. I’m now exploring routing protocols, IP classes, and subnetting as I continue building my skills in networking and cybersecurity.
